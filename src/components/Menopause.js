        Menopause is one such time in life where you may find yourself feeling
        greater levels of stress and anxiety. Menopause, rather like puberty, is
        a transitional phase marked by wildly fluctuating hormones and often
        strange and disruptive symptoms. These symptoms are many and varied and
        include common problems including; poor quality sleep compounded by hot
        flushes, sweating, low mood, loss of libido, and a variety of other
        physical and psychological symptoms.

        Clinical hypnotherapy has been shown to be an effective method in
        helping with many of the symptoms associated with the menopause
        including hot flushes, brain fog, and fatigue. Hypnotherapy is a safe
        and natural treatment for the menopause. It may be used either as an
        alternative to HRT for those who are either unable to access the
        treatment or choose not to, or it may be used to complement HRT users.
        Studies have shown that menopausal women in the workplace are 50% less
        likely to go for promotion, 30% more likely to seek early retirement,
        and 20% choose to leave the workforce as they find their symptoms
        unmanageable.
